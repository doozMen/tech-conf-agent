## Knowledge Assessment

### What the MCP Knows Better Than...

#### 1. Someone Who Hasn't Attended

**MCP Knowledge**:
- ✅ Complete conference schedule (8 sessions, Oct 15-17, 2025)
- ✅ 30+ speaker profiles with expertise
- ✅ 6+ venue locations with accessibility details
- ✅ Session prerequisites and learning outcomes
- ✅ Real-time availability and capacity
- ✅ Related session recommendations
- ✅ Equipment and amenities per room

**Non-Attendee Knowledge**:
- ❌ Vague "it's a Swift conference"
- ❌ No speaker details
- ❌ No venue information
- ❌ No personalization

**Assessment**: MCP has **complete conference knowledge graph** vs casual awareness

---

#### 2. Someone Reading the Schedule

**MCP Knowledge**:
- ✅ Can search across all fields (title, description, tags, speakers)
- ✅ Multi-dimensional filtering (track + difficulty + format + time)
- ✅ Related sessions with similarity scores
- ✅ Speaker bios and session history
- ✅ Real-time capacity and status
- ✅ Cross-references (session → speaker → venue)

**Schedule Reader Knowledge**:
- ❌ Linear browsing only
- ❌ Manual filtering
- ❌ No semantic search
- ❌ No recommendations
- ❌ Static information

**Assessment**: MCP provides **intelligent navigation** vs linear reading

---

#### 3. A General AI Without Conference Data

**MCP-Powered Claude**:
- ✅ Direct access to conference database
- ✅ Structured data with types
- ✅ Real-time session status
- ✅ Can answer specific queries (times, rooms, speakers)
- ✅ Multi-hop reasoning (filter + search + recommend)
- ✅ Personalization (favorites, notes, ratings)

**General AI (ChatGPT, Claude without MCP)**:
- ❌ No conference knowledge
- ❌ Can only provide generic advice
- ❌ No specific session information
- ❌ No real-time data
- ❌ Cannot reference actual speakers/sessions

**Assessment**: MCP provides **domain-specific expertise** vs general knowledge

---

### Complex Query Test

**Question**: "I'm an intermediate iOS developer interested in performance. What should I attend tomorrow morning, and can I get to the rooms from Main Hall A?"

**MCP Response** (Multi-tool workflow):
1. Uses `list_sessions` with filters: difficulty=intermediate, track contains "performance" or "iOS"
2. Uses `get_schedule` for tomorrow morning (08:00-12:00)
3. Uses `find_room` for each session venue
4. Calculates walking routes from Main Hall A

Result: Personalized itinerary with logistics

**Non-MCP Response**:
```
Can't access real-time schedule or venue maps.
```

**Assessment**: MCP performs **multi-step reasoning with context** vs unable to help
