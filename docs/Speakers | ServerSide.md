## Key Conference Themes

### Swift 6 & Concurrency
The conference heavily features Swift 6's strict concurrency model and its application to server-side development. Multiple speakers (Matt Massicotte, Mikaela Caron) demonstrate practical patterns for handling high-load concurrent requests with proper actor isolation and compile-time data race prevention.

### Production-Ready Frameworks
Both Vapor and Hummingbird are showcased as mature, production-ready frameworks. Emma Gaubert's framework comparison and Adam Fowler's Hummingbird expertise help teams make informed architectural decisions based on their specific needs (database requirements, deployment targets, team preferences).

### Cloud-Native Swift
Strong focus on cloud platform integration with talks covering AWS Lambda (Ben Rosen's SongShift), AWS Bedrock (Mona Dierickx), and serverless patterns. Demonstrates how Swift integrates cleanly with modern cloud infrastructure using first-class SDKs.

### Type Safety Across the Stack
Multiple talks emphasize Swift's type system benefits for server-side development: Adam Fowler's parameter packs for Redis commands, Mona's type-safe AWS model selection, and shared SPM packages between client and server preventing production bugs.

### Performance & Optimization
Advanced topics including Joannis Orlandos' zero-copy networking with Span, performance tuning for high-throughput applications, and memory-efficient patterns for IoT/embedded systems.

### Apple's Server-Side Investment
Strong representation from Apple's Swift Server team (Franz Busch, George Barnett, Honza Dvorsky, Ben Cohen, Si Beaumont, Eric Ernst, Agam Dua) demonstrating Apple's commitment to server-side Swift with SwiftNIO, gRPC, tooling, and ecosystem development.

### Real-World Production Stories
Conference features actual production deployments: SongShift's serverless architecture, Mikaela's Fruitful networking app, TelemetryDeck's analytics platform, demonstrating that server-side Swift is ready for real-world use.
