## Comparison: MCP vs Non-MCP Approaches

### Traditional Search (Without MCP)

**Method**: Manual website browsing, PDF schedule, conference app

**Limitations**:
1. **Fragmented Information**: Speaker bios on one page, sessions on another, schedule elsewhere
2. **Poor Search**: Basic keyword search, no semantic understanding
3. **No Context**: Can't ask "Who from Apple is speaking?" - must scan manually
4. **No Recommendations**: No related session suggestions
5. **Time-Consuming**: Multiple clicks, page loads, context switching
6. **No Personalization**: Can't filter by skill level + topic simultaneously
7. **Static**: Schedule conflicts not automatically identified

**Example User Journey**:
1. Google "serverside swift conference 2025"
2. Navigate to conference website
3. Click "Schedule" tab
4. Scroll through 3 days to find Vapor sessions
5. Click each session individually to see details
6. Open new tab to check speaker bio
7. Return to schedule, repeat for each interesting session
8. Manually note conflicts in external app

**Time**: 15-30 minutes for basic exploration

---

### General AI Assistant (Claude without MCP)

**Method**: Ask Claude general questions without conference data access

**Limitations**:
1. **No Current Data**: Knowledge cutoff means no 2025 conference details
2. **Hallucination Risk**: May invent session names, speakers, or times
3. **Generic Answers**: Can explain Vapor/SwiftNIO but not specific conference sessions
4. **No Schedule**: Cannot answer "What's happening tomorrow at 2pm?"
5. **No Speakers**: Cannot provide bios or expertise for specific presenters
6. **No Verification**: User must manually verify all information

**Example Exchange**:
- User: "What Vapor sessions are at ServerSide.swift 2025?"
- Claude: "I don't have access to the specific 2025 conference schedule. However, typical server-side Swift conferences usually include sessions on Vapor fundamentals, advanced topics like Fluent ORM, authentication, and deployment. You should check the conference website for the exact schedule."

**Result**: Helpful general context, but no actionable information.
