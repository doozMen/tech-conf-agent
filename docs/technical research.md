# ServerSide Swift 2025 Conference: Comprehensive Technical Research and Speaker Backgrounds

The ServerSide Swift 2025 conference in London (October 2-3, 2025) showcases cutting-edge developments in server-side Swift. This research validates technical claims and provides detailed speaker backgrounds for a comprehensive blog post.

## Swift Language Features: Modern Server Development

**Parameter Packs (SE-0393) revolutionize type-safe APIs**. Accepted in April 2023 and available in Swift 5.9+, parameter packs introduce variadic generics that enable abstracting over variable numbers of types. The valkey-swift client library demonstrates this powerfully: developers can now pipeline multiple Redis commands with full type safety and no artificial limits. Before parameter packs, frameworks were limited to creating dozens of function overloads. Now, a single generic function handles any number of commands while preserving each command's specific return type at compile time. SwiftUI eliminated its 10-view limit using this feature, and database clients like valkey-swift achieve zero-copy performance without type erasure.

**Swift 6 concurrency makes strict concurrency checking practical**. SE-0414 (Region-Based Isolation) represents the breakthrough that enables Swift 6 adoption. This revolutionary static analysis proves data race safety without requiring Sendable conformance by analyzing code flow to determine when non-Sendable values are used safely across isolation boundaries. Combined with SE-0430 (sending parameter and result values), developers can transfer ownership of non-Sendable types across actors. SE-0420 (Inheritance of Actor Isolation) eliminates unnecessary suspensions in middleware chains by allowing async functions to inherit caller's isolation. SE-0417 (Task Executor Preference) provides low-level performance tuning for actor execution context, critical for sub-millisecond latency requirements. These proposals work together to make Swift 6's strict concurrency checking practical for production server applications.

**C++ interoperability (SE-0425) unlocks decades of high-performance libraries**. Available since Swift 5.9, C++ interop enables bidirectional integration between Swift and C++. Server-side applications can now leverage Apache Arrow for analytics, RocksDB for embedded storage, zstd for compression, and ONNX Runtime for machine learning—all with zero rewrites. The comprehensive Swift.org documentation covers type mappings, reference semantics (SWIFT_SHARED_REFERENCE, SWIFT_IMMORTAL_REFERENCE), and collection protocol conformance. While exceptions remain unsupported and C++20 modules are pending, the current implementation provides production-ready access to the entire C++ ecosystem.

**Swift/Java interoperability enables gradual migration**. The swift-java project (github.com/swiftlang/swift-java) remains in early prototype status but shows promising potential. Apple's Password Monitoring Service migration from Java to Swift achieved a 40% throughput increase, 50% hardware reduction, and 90% memory decrease. The project supports both JNI (legacy compatibility) and FFM API (modern approach requiring JDK 22+), with bidirectional code generation. While experimental and not production-ready, it provides a migration path for large Java codebases.

**Distributed actors (SE-0336) extend actors to distributed systems**. Accepted in December 2021 and available since Swift 5.7, distributed actors provide location transparency where the same code works for both local and remote actors. The swift-distributed-actors library (github.com/apple/swift-distributed-actors) implements peer-to-peer clustering with membership, failure detection, routing, and sharding. SE-0428 (under consideration) aims to enable client/server split for heterogeneous systems, allowing protocol-based resolution across different service implementations.

## AWS Ecosystem: Production-Ready Serverless Swift

**Swift AWS Lambda Runtime delivers sub-200ms cold starts**. Maintained by the Swift Server Working Group (github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime), the runtime implements the AWS Lambda Runtime API on top of SwiftNIO. Version 2 provides async/await native support, Codable adapters, response streaming (200 MB soft limit vs 6 MB buffered), and background task execution. Cold start benchmarks show Swift with Amazon Linux 2 averaging 190-219ms—faster than C# .NET (224ms) and Java (358ms), though slower than Rust (30ms) and Go (75ms). Warm execution performance at 1.19ms matches Node.js, Python, and Java. The 15-minute Lambda timeout is a hard AWS limit with no exceptions, but API Gateway WebSocket connections support up to 2 hours using the @connection API for posting messages after the initial 29-second integration timeout.

**Soto SDK provides complete AWS service coverage**. The community-maintained Soto project (github.com/soto-project/soto, v7.x, SSWG Graduated) offers Swift APIs for all 200+ AWS services through automated code generation from Amazon's official JSON model files. Built on SwiftNIO with async/await support, it includes specialized projects like soto-s3-file-transfer and soto-cognito-authentication-kit. The official AWS SDK for Swift (github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift) represents AWS's newer official effort using Smithy framework architecture. Both are production-ready with different architectural approaches.

**AWS Bedrock integration supports streaming chat and image generation**. The AWS SDK for Swift includes official Bedrock support through AWSBedrock (control plane), AWSBedrockRuntime (inference), AWSBedrockAgent (management), and AWSBedrockAgentRuntime (invocation) modules. The Converse API provides unified streaming chat across Amazon Nova (Micro, Lite, Pro, Canvas, Reel), Anthropic Claude (3.5 Sonnet, 3.7 Sonnet, 4 Opus, 4.1 Opus), Meta Llama (2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3), and other models. Amazon Nova Canvas enables text-to-image generation, inpainting, background removal, and style transfer. **Important clarification**: Research found no "Mona Dierickx's Swift Bedrock Library" as a separate project—AWS Bedrock support comes through the official AWS SDK for Swift, to which Mona Dierickx contributed documentation and examples during her AWS internship.

**Terraform integration enables infrastructure as code**. Swift Lambda functions deploy using standard Terraform aws_lambda_function resources with runtime = "provided.al2023". The Swift Cloud project (github.com/swift-cloud/swift-cloud) offers native Swift IaC that compiles to Pulumi YAML. Ryan Token's serverless Swift sports automation project demonstrates \<$0.20/month operational costs with 198ms cold starts and 709ms warm execution including external API calls.

## Server Frameworks: Hummingbird vs Vapor

**Hummingbird represents Swift 6-first architecture**. Created by Adam Fowler (github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird), Hummingbird 2.0 was completely rebuilt in 2024 with structured concurrency at its core. The framework requires only six core dependencies (swift-nio, swift-log, swift-service-lifecycle, swift-metrics, swift-backtrace, swift-nio-extras) with no Foundation requirement in core. Built purely on SwiftNIO with async/await throughout, Hummingbird provides modular extension packages: HummingbirdRouter (result builders), HummingbirdFluent (Vapor's ORM), HummingbirdRedis (RediStack integration), HummingbirdWebSocket, HummingbirdLambda, HummingbirdMustache, and HummingbirdAuth. The customizable request context system and protocol-based middleware architecture make it ideal for microservices and serverless deployments requiring minimal dependencies.

**Vapor offers batteries-included maturity**. With 24k+ GitHub stars and 13k+ Discord members, Vapor 4 (github.com/vapor/vapor, vapor.codes) provides comprehensive features built on SwiftNIO with async/await layered over EventLoopFuture foundations. Fluent ORM supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MongoDB with powerful property wrappers (@ID, @Field, @Parent, @Children, @Siblings) and migration system. JWT authentication through vapor/jwt-kit enables refresh token rotation patterns. The middleware system includes CORS, file serving, error handling, and sessions out of the box. Redis caching via vapor/redis provides production-ready distributed caching. WebSocket support handles both server-side and client-side connections with async/await APIs. Vapor excels for full-featured web applications where a comprehensive ecosystem outweighs dependency minimalism.

**Framework selection depends on project requirements**. Choose Hummingbird for Swift 6 migration projects, microservices requiring minimal footprint, maximum modularity, and structured concurrency benefits. Choose Vapor for batteries-included development, extensive ecosystem support, teams new to server-side Swift, and applications benefiting from mature ORM capabilities. Both frameworks maintain compatibility through shared libraries like Fluent, and many developers use both for different use cases.

## Networking Protocols: Type-Safe and High-Performance

**Valkey-swift leverages parameter packs for type-safe pipelining**. The preview release (github.com/valkey-io/valkey-swift) demonstrates cutting-edge Swift features: actor-based ValkeyConnection for thread safety, parameter pack-based execute() returning tuples with correct types per command, code-generated commands from Valkey's JSON specifications, and structured concurrency throughout. ValkeyClusterClient provides election-based topology discovery, automatic command routing by key hashslots, MOVED error handling during resharding, connection pooling per node, and circuit breaking during disruptions. The pub/sub API uses AsyncSequence with automatic SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE management. Valkey-swift supports both Valkey and Redis databases ≤ v7.2.4 using RESP3 protocol.

**RediStack predates modern concurrency**. Maintained by Joannis Orlandos and Fabian Fett (github.com/swift-server/RediStack, SSWG Sandbox), RediStack uses EventLoopFuture-based APIs and RESP2 protocol. While mature and established since 2019, it requires manual EventLoop management and type conversion. Valkey-swift represents the modern evolution with async/await, structured concurrency, and superior type safety through parameter packs.

**gRPC Swift 2 embraces async/await**. Lead developer George Barnett announced gRPC Swift 2 (github.com/grpc/grpc-swift-2, swift.org/blog/grpc-swift-2) at gRPConf 2024 as a complete rewrite leveraging modern Swift concurrency. The modular ecosystem includes grpc-swift-2 (core runtime), grpc-swift-nio-transport (HTTP/2 via SwiftNIO), grpc-swift-protobuf (Protocol Buffers integration with code generator), and grpc-swift-extras (health service, reflection, OpenTelemetry, Swift Service Lifecycle). Protocol Buffers provide binary serialization with smaller messages than JSON, faster processing, and efficient encoding. The four RPC types (unary, server streaming, client streaming, bidirectional streaming) cover all communication patterns. Service reflection with grpcurl enables runtime introspection. Error handling uses standard gRPC status codes with RPCErrorConvertible for custom error types. Automatic retry mechanisms, client-side load balancing, and keepalive configuration provide production-ready reliability.

**Swift NIO forms the foundation**. All networking libraries build on SwiftNIO (github.com/apple/swift-nio). The eight fundamental types (EventLoopGroup, EventLoop, Channel, ChannelHandler, Bootstrap structures, ByteBuffer, EventLoopFuture, EventLoopPromise) provide non-blocking I/O with kqueue/epoll selectors. The event loop model ensures single-threaded execution per EventLoop for thread-safety. Channel pipelines process events through doubly-linked lists of ChannelHandlers, with inbound data flowing socket → handler chain → application and outbound flowing application → handler chain → socket. Hummingbird abstracts SwiftNIO through HBHTTPResponder protocol. Vapor builds on SwiftNIO's EventLoop model. gRPC Swift uses swift-nio-http2 for HTTP/2 transport. This shared foundation ensures consistency across the ecosystem.

## Data Persistence and Orchestration

**MongoKitten implements native BSON parsing**. Created by Joannis Orlandos (github.com/orlandos-nl/MongoKitten, v7.9.0+, SSWG Incubating), MongoKitten is a pure Swift MongoDB driver with no C dependencies except SSL. The companion BSON library (github.com/orlandos-nl/BSON) implements BSON specification v1.1 with on-demand parsing, delayed data copies for performance, and native Swift type integration. BSONEncoder/BSONDecoder provide Codable support producing Document types instead of Data. This differs fundamentally from JSON—BSON stores binary data directly, supports additional types like ObjectId and Date natively, and maintains type information JSON cannot preserve. Built on SwiftNIO with async/await patterns, MongoKitten supports MongoDB 3.6+ with features including GridFS for large files, change streams for real-time monitoring, ACID transactions (MongoDB 4.0+ replica sets), and aggregation pipelines. The Meow ORM layer adds type-safe query building with @Field property wrappers.

**Swift Temporal SDK remains experimental**. Temporal documentation lists a Swift SDK as third-party community project, but no official implementation exists in temporal-community or temporalio organizations. For production server-side Swift with Temporal, developers must use official Go/Python/Java SDKs via interop or contribute to community Swift SDK development. The Temporal platform's durable execution patterns—workflow-as-code, automatic state persistence, resumability, workflow/activity model—would benefit Swift server applications once a mature implementation emerges.

**Swift containerization enables VM-per-container isolation**. Announced at WWDC 2025 by Eric Ernst and Apple's container runtime team, the containerization project (github.com/apple/containerization with CLI tool github.com/apple/container) provides OCI-compliant Linux containers on macOS. The unique architecture runs each container in its own lightweight VM using macOS Virtualization.framework for hardware-level isolation. Sub-second boot times result from an optimized Linux kernel (6.12+), minimal root filesystem, and vminitd init system written in Swift. ContainerizationEXT4 formats EXT4 filesystems and populates them programmatically. ContainerizationNetlink configures dedicated IP addresses per container without port forwarding. ContainerizationOCI manages OCI images with full Docker Hub compatibility. The system achieves security through VM isolation while maintaining container-like performance, offering an open-source alternative to Docker Desktop optimized for Apple Silicon.
