    - [https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server)
    - [https://lobehub.com/mcp/tjzaks-gmail-mcp-server](https://lobehub.com/mcp/tjzaks-gmail-mcp-server) or others mcp for corparate and private gemail
    Here’s a direct comparison between the **GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server** and **tjzaks-gmail-mcp-server** based on the documentation you attached, focusing on use cases relevant to advanced MCP/AI integration for both corporate and private Gmail. I’ll highlight technical, operational, and workflow features—plus where each excels—so you can select what best fits your requirements as an AI developer.


| Feature | GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server | tjzaks-gmail-mcp-server |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Auth Options** | Full support for OAuth2 (desktop, web, cloud/corporate via custom domain/redirect). Ideal for corporate, cloud, n8n, and desktop. Batch/global credentials for multi-user environments. | OAuth2 only for Desktop; primarily local/consumer Gmail accounts. No cloud/corporate callback workflow described. |
| **Attachment Support** | **Robust:** Send, receive, display filenames/types/sizes, batch download, MIME parsing, multi-format. | Core: Send, read, and manage attachments. Less detail on batch processing or enhanced metadata. |
| **Label/Filter Management** | **Comprehensive:** Create, update, delete, batch, automated label/folder management. Full Gmail filters: create, get, delete; prebuilt templates for common workflows (newsletters, urgent mails, etc.). | Minimal described; basic send/search/read labels may be present, but no templates or batch operations documentation. |
| **Batch Operations** | **Efficient:** Batch label changes, batch deletes/support for bulk mailbox management. | Not detailed. Focus on one-at-a-time ops. |
| **Integration with Claude Desktop** | **Direct, full-featured MCP config:** Works with Claude via npx, Docker, or custom config (macOS, Linux, Windows, cloud). | Simple integration via Claude config and Node script. Mainly for local AI agent use. |
| **International/Enterprise Support** | Unicode, multipart, non-ASCII character support. Customizable for business and global email scenarios. | Basic email reading/sending, not specifically highlighted. |
| **Installation/Ease of Use** | npx, Docker, or standard Node project. Simple credential/global credential setup. Advanced deployment scenarios supported. | Node/npm only; straightforward for local/test/dev scenarios. Credentials must be in project folder. |
| **Advanced Features** | Search syntax (Gmail operators), MIME support, extensive filtering, custom callback for cloud/N8N, reverse proxy instructions for true corporate deployments. | Basic OAuth desktop flow, no corporate-specific setup. Mostly “local-first” for Claude Code users. |
| **Security \& Config Management** | Credentials stored per-user and globally, never permanent file storage of attachments; explicit instructions for secure usage in team/corporate setups. | Credentials local. No multi-user, global, or advanced corp instructions. |
| **Community/Support** | 738 stars, MIT, 190 forks, contributors, issues, eval package, active readme | Smaller, less active, “made for Claude Code,” quick install guide, but not comparable community footprint. |

**Summary:**

- For **corporate Gmail, cloud deployments, and advanced automation workflows**, **GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server** is more feature-rich and robust. It’s specifically designed for scalable, enterprise, and developer use—including batch ops, advanced filter/label management, attachment workflows, and seamless integration for different environments (desktop, Docker, cloud, proxy, etc.).[^1]
- For **private Gmail, local/desktop use, quick Claude MCP integration for individual AI agent users**, **tjzaks-gmail-mcp-server** is easier to set up but less powerful. It’s perfect for “quick connect” proof-of-concept or personal agent experiments, not enterprise.[^2]

**Other MCPs for Gmail?**

- Enterprise/corporate-grade alternatives are rare. Most open source MCP connectors target personal agents. For Microsoft/Exchange, solutions like O365 REST MCP bridge (not open-sourced widely) exist. For private Gmail, these two are top community picks.
- For broader **corporate workflow**, GongRzhe is ideal because it’s ready for containerized, cloud, and multi-user environments.

**Recommendation:**

- **GongRzhe/Gmail-MCP-Server** is the clear winner for professional, corporate, and advanced automation settings—especially if you need robust filter/label/attachment capabilities, batch ops, or integration with cloud or desktop environments.
- If your use case is quick personal desktop agent use with Claude Code, and you want minimal config, **tjzaks-gmail-mcp-server** is fine for testing.

Let me know what your exact AI/MCP workflow target or setup is (corporate, hybrid, local), and I can recommend further integration tips!
